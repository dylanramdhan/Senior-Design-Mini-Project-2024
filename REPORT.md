# Senior Design: Mini-Project
### Engineers: Dylan Ramdhan & Beren Donmez

In this assignment we were given the task of operating a hardware and software of a Raspberry Pi Pico 
that is attached to an Freenove Pico breakout board.

## Part 1: Light Sensor
We uploaded the light.py code and saw the yellow light on Pi Pico board

## Part 2: Playing Songs
Our code plays a melody using a speaker connected to a microcontroller. It defines a series of musical notes and their frequencies, along with how long each note should be played. The speaker is controlled using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), which allows it to produce sound at different frequencies.

## Part 3: Cloud Server/Light Game


Our code measures how fast we can press a button when an LED turns on. It connects to our network, blinks the LED randomly for a short time, and records how quickly we respond. After a set number of attempts, it calculated your fastest, slowest, and average response times.
